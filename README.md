A long-term lab for building autonomous AI agents.

This repository documents 1,000+ days of designing and implementing agent systems — memory, planning, state, and execution — from first principles.

The focus is bridging machine learning research and real-world autonomy.

Time horizon: 2026 → 2035.

By 2029, agents will be infrastructure.
This is where the work begins
